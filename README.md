As far as the world goes, there always seems to be something that changes the way things work. With the healthcare industry, however, it’s a big challenge to incorporate technology into daily tasks. Up until recently, technology had been separated from the medical sector. As it turns out, virtual reality is a game changer for the healthcare community. VR has proven to serve multiple purposes in medicine and its useful applications have been numerous. These applications range from training medical students to treating patients, and have proven to be extremely efficient.
 
 Medical Training:
 
To begin with, medical training has been standarized for so long. Students usually graduated medical school through training with mannequins and training software. However, VR was revolutionized the training of students and brought through incredible opportunities for students to be experienced doctors trained for any and every situation. One of the factors that makes VR so important for student experience is the simulation of emergency rooms. In fact, while training on mannequins, you don’t get to experience the incredibly pressuring environment that comes with being with operating on real human in a fast-paced environment. VR brings that through by taking the students into the real deal experience. In addition to feeling the emergency room trauma, VR most importantly allows students to access aspects of human body that were never possible before. The corpses that medical students practice with will make it hard for the students to envision the reaction of a live patient’s body to every move they make, and it’s obviously impossible to visualize what everything inside that body looks like when it’s alive without technology like VR. Frankly, VR plays a huge role in helping students understand human anatomy through 360° overviews of the human body. That’s why, student training after VR will never be the same.
 
 
 Mental Health Treatment:
 
Another aspect of VR in healthcare is its presence and importance in treating patient mental health issues. Treating mental illnesses could be a really complex process for therapists because it requires different methods for different needs. However, the flexibility of VR makes things more easily manageable. This shows through multiple features of VR that allow it to facilitate and improve the quality of therapy that the patient is receiving. One of the features of VR that allows for facilitated process in therapy is the immersive environment it’s able to create for the patient that they would likely avoid being in in their real life.  It could put them in places they fear and in situations they dread facing up to. The one thing remains, though, is that it’s a simulation and the patient will likely feel at ease that it’s not a real life occurrence. Helping patients endure situations they would otherwise avoid and find challenging is one way to help them explore their abilities and improve their overall relationship with that situation. The flexibility of VR helps “in-situ coaching” by miles through its ability to take the patient back to the situation that’s causing them pain so that they could remember it, understand it and deal with it better. In short, incorporating VR has brought therapists a step closer into being able to understand their patients’ needs better.
 
 
 Medical Marketing:
 
Medical Marketing is rather an unfamiliar term. We rarely think of how certain medicine and treatments are being marketed. We usually just trust what is prescribed for us, but we do not think of the factors that made us trust these treatments and feel at ease with them. In fact, patients understanding and trusting their treatment is as good as getting the treatment itself. Understanding how your body works and how it will respond to the product or operation that you will undergo is essential for patient satisfaction. Fortunately, VR has boosted Medical Marketing by allowing patients to be educated on what happens inside their body and how their bodies will respond to these medications and treatments. Patients experiencing a simulation of what they want to know will earn doctors and the healthcare communites their loyalty and trust.
One of the best examples of Medical Marketing through VR happens to be the GSK migraine simulator called “The Migraine Experience” which took place back in 2016. GSK worked with an advertising agency and migraine patients to a simulation of what a migraine feels like except without the pain. This experience in itself was meant to advertise their Excedirin Migraine Medication, and in order for people to trust the medication and understand its importance, they needed to help them visualize and empathize with those suffering migraines and then propose their medication as an effective solution.
 
 Disease awareness:
 
The advantage of VR in helping people understand diseases goes even beyond Medical Marketing. In fact, VR helps the healthcare community raise awareness to common disease symptoms that are often overlooked and helps patients understand the urgency of listening to their body.
 
 VR in Delivery Rooms:
 
Last but not least, one of the most surprising upsides of VR in healthcare happens to be its ability to ease labor pain for women. Apparently, the lessening of delivery and labor pains by VR have been under several studies recently due to its efficiency and positive outcomes in several situations with numerous women. The way it works is it helps women reduce their anxiety and stress through colorful scenes, patterns, and sounds in addition to relaxtion coaching done through the headset which makes them lose track of time and eventually eases the pain. The results have varied between several women, especially since some of which found it uncomfortable to have a headset on during labor. However, the fact that it has worked on several patients and helped ease the pain is quite an impressive outcome that deserves to be studied further.

 Future of VR in Healthcare:
 
Overall, VR has brought by unforeseen advantages to the healthcare sector. It has reshaped several traditional methods that we didn’t know could possibly be improved. Starting with training medical students with a simulation of live patients instead of cadavers and moving to helping patient treatment and alleviating delivery and labor pain for women only in its first couple of years, it is highly expected that VR will be improved through more and more studies pushing the healthcare sector into unimaginable levels of advancement.
